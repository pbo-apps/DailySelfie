# DailySelfie
Lab project from week 5 of Adam Porter's Coursera course, Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems: Part 2
https://www.coursera.org/learn/android-programming-2/home/welcome

Lab Objectives:
Create an application from scratch that periodically reminds the user to take a selfie - a picture of one's self taken from one's device. Over time the user will capture many selfies and thus will be able to see him or herself change over some period of time.
